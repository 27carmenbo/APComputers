	<h3>Book Recommendation</h3>
		<img src = "redqueen.jpg" width = "50%">
	<p>I love this book called Red Queen by Victoria Aveyard. It is the first book in the Red Queen series and is a fantasy/science fiction novel about Mare, a teenage girl, who is raised in a world of red bloods and silver bloods who hold more power. it is very intriguing and plot driven. </p>
